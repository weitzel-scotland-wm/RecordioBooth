    <p>Recordio Studios - Studio Policies, Terms & Conditions (Print out this document, fill out and sign bottom, and bring to your first recording session.)
        Recordio Studio is a professional audio recording facility. Customer Service and satisfaction are our
        top priority. The following policies insure that all sessions are conducted in the most professional manner while
        providing our client a creative and comfortable environment.
        DEPOSIT/REQUESTING TIME SLOT
        A 50% deposit 14 days in advance of your session will guarantee the time slot you request. Without a deposit, if someone
        else wants the same time slot and offers a deposit, it will go to them. Deposits can be taken over the phone using a credit
        card.
        BOOKING RATES
        Sessions are booked at the rates published by the studio (subject to change) unless other rates have been negotiated.
        There is a 4 hour minimum. Time will be billed in quarter hour increments. Sessions that run longer than the original
        scheduled time will be booked at the published rate assuming the studio is available. Lockout sessions are based on 12-
        hour days. Additional time will be charged at our standard hourly rate.
        CANCELLATION FEE
        Cancellations after 48 hours forfeit the deposit unless we can rebook your time. You will then receive a refund of your
        deposit for any portion of time that we are able to rebook.
        STUDIO TOURS
        It is recommended that new clients tour the studio prior to their first session. During this time we can discuss the
        parameters of your session and make a plan to ensure everything runs smoothly.
        START/END AND SESSION TIMES
        The session clock begins at the scheduled time that both parties agree upon. If you arrive early and the studio can
        accommodate an early start, then the session clock will begin at that time. If you are late for any reason, you will be
        charged from the scheduled session start time, with no exceptions. Please call if you are going to be late! Set up time will
        be billed at regular studio rates unless other arrangements are agreed to. This includes load-in and instrument setup,
        microphone placement, level setting, media transfer, etc.
